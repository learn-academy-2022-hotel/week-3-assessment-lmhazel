# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is JSX? What is one syntax difference between HTML and JSX?

Your answer:JSX is the way in which JavaScript is used in React. JSX is used within {curly braces} in React. One syntax difference between HTML and JSX is that HTML requires React fragments while JSX can use self-closing tags called JSX tags 

Researched answer: JSX is the usage of JavaScript in React. It is useful for UI development and gives you all the potential that JavaScript can provide. One syntax difference between HTML and JXS is that HTML requires React fragments (example <div></div>) in order to return a piece of code. JSX, on the other hand, uses self-closing tags called JSX tags that appear as so <input type="text" />/. 

2. What is yarn? What file(s) are modified in a React application when you run the command yarn in your terminal?

Your answer: Yarn stands for "Yet Another Resource Negotiator" and is used to run React in a browser. The file modified in a React application when you run the command yarn in your terminal are app.js and 

Researched answer: Yarn stands for "Yet Another Resource Negotiator" and when it is ran, sets up all the files needed to run React. It is necessary for using React because yarn opens a local server in the browser where code is rendered. The files modified in a React application when you run the command yarn in your terminal are App.js and index.html. 

3. What is a React component?

Your answer: A React component is a folder created in React where files are stored that house different parts of what the coder wants displayed on the browers. For example, if a developer wants to create a browser that takes in a text input and displays the text in a larger font, then the developer puts the function and all logic for this project into App.js and then creates a folder named components and a file in the components folder. This way, the file and the code within it can be reused and work independently. 

Researched answer: All of React is made up of components. React components is a folder held in a React projet that holds multiple files in which code is stored. This makes it more dynamic and scalable which is ideal for many companies. A way React components could work is if a developer wants to create a browser that takes in a text input and displays the text in a larger font, then the developer puts the function and all logic for this project into App.js and then creates a folder named components and a file in the components folder. This way, the file and the code within it can be reused and work independently. 

4. What is the difference between state values and props in React?

Your answer: State values are what is displayed in the browers when it is refreshed or at it's default. Props are used when variables are taken from the parent file to a child file. 

Researched answer: State values are used to hold data which is used in a component. When a component is holding a state value it is called a logic component. When the value of state changes, the component is able to render this new data making it very useful for making a code dynamic. Props (properties) are used to pass info along from parents components to nested components. Unlike state values, props cannot change. 

5. What is the DOM?

Your answer: DOM stands for Document Object Model. This is what the browser shows to the user after assessing the code. 

Researched answer: DOm stands for Document Object Model and is what the browser displays to the user. DOM is useful because it updates only the parts of the browser that have been changed in the code instead of refreshing the entire browser. This is useful for things such as hovering over a part of the browser and only changing one part of the browser instead of the entire page. 

6. STRETCH: Which is the difference between a div and a span?

Your answer: A div is used to divide parts of HTML. 

Researched answer: A div is a tag (noted as <div></div>) and contain parts of HTML code that should be separated. It's very useful and popular because it generic. Like div, span is a way to split up blocks of code. Span is denoted as <span></span> and is normally used for styling purposes. 

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Object-oriented programming: a method of coding in which code is split up into smaller pieces so that if one small change is made to one part of the code it does not cause issues with the entire project

2. Ruby: a coding language that is built intently for Object-oriented programming and is typically used for creating web applications

3. Implicit return: when a return is not specificed when using Ruby, the last line of code will be returned

4. Ruby blocks: used to determine the outcome of a function

5. Ruby hashes: is similar to an array excpet intead of index used to represent the location of a variable, hash uses unique keys
